Welcome to the Customer Segment Project! In this project, I delve into the world of customer segmentation using the powerful techniques of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis. I employ a combination of SQL for analysis, Power Query for data extraction, and Power BI to create interactive dashboards.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and value. Our process involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Analysis with SQL**:
   I dive into the data using SQL to analyze customer behavior in terms of recency, frequency, and monetary value. This forms the foundation for segmenting customers effectively.

2. **Data Extraction with Power Query**:
   Using Power Query, I extract and transform data to fit our analysis needs. This step is crucial for preparing the data for deeper insights.

3. **Interactive Dashboards with Power BI**:
   Leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, I create visually appealing and interactive dashboards that allow us to visualize and communicate our findings effectively.

## Technologies Utilized

- SQL: For in-depth data analysis and segmentation.
- Power Query: To extract, transform, and prepare data for analysis.
- Power BI: To create dynamic and visually appealing dashboards.

Through this project, I aim to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling better decision-making and more targeted strategies.
